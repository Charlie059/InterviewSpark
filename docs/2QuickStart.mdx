# Quick Start

Before you Begin:

1. Ensure you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. An active AWS account is crucial. If you don't have one, sign up at the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
3. Familiarize yourself with AWS Amplify. It will be instrumental in deploying and managing InterviewSpark.

And use the following command to clone the InterviewSpark Repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charlie059/InterviewSpark.git
   ```

Navigating into the cloned directory and install the required dependencies by `npm insall`:

```bash
cd InterviewSpark
npm install
   ```

Pull the Amplify configurations from the cloud:

üî¥‚ùó**NOTE**‚ùó**You might require the `accessKey` and `secretAccessKey` to gain access to the cloud! Please contact the team!**

```bash
amplify pull --appId d38e770jlxdzpa --envName staging
   ```
If any error occurred, it's worth considering to delete the `~/amplify`
folder and pull the amplify again from the cloud using command above.
For more information about Amplify, please refer to [AWS Amplify Docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/).
üî¥‚ùó**IMPORTANT**‚ùó**In any circumstances, DO NOT use command `amplify delete`**


Then use the following command to start the server
```bash
npm run dev
   ```
Now you can open a browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
