# InterviewSpark Documentation

Welcome to InterviewSpark Documentation! This guide provides an in-depth overview of all functionalities, integrations, and architectural designs of our platform.
**InterviewSpark** is an AI-enhanced mock interview tool that aids job seekers in refining their interview skills, offering them a confidence boost. Utilizing React and fortified by AWS Amplify, it combines an extensive array of UI components, pages, and plugins to simulate an all-encompassing mock interview.

To start and set-up environment for the project,
please refer to  [Quick Start](?path=/docs/get-started-quick-start--docs).

To work with the team, please firstly read [Workflow](?path=/docs/get-started-workflow--docs).

## Why Storybook
This doc was written in Storybook. It provides a relatively isolated environment,
that allows us to test each individual component without rendering it to the page,
while verifying all cases of UI.

To start story book, use the following CLI command:
```console
npm run storybook
```

Please refer to  [Document Writing](?path=/docs/get-started-document-writing--docs) for information about
how to write implementation doc for this project.
