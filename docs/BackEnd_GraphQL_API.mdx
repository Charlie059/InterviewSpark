# GraphQL API
This is documentation for GraphQL API. This API allows you to access
various resources and perform operations on them.


## Welcome to GraphQL

_GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows developers to specify the data they need and receive it in a single request. It provides a flexible, efficient, and powerful approach to building APIs that can be used by a wide range of applications._

_AWS AppSync is a managed service that makes it easy to develop GraphQL APIs by handling the heavy lifting of securely connecting to data sources like AWS DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and more. With AppSync, developers can build scalable, real-time applications that work on multiple platforms, including mobile and web. It also provides features like authentication and authorization, caching, and offline capabilities, making it an ideal choice for building modern applications._

## AWS AppSync GraphQL

AWS AppSync GraphQL's VTL (Velocity Template Language) pipeline is a powerful feature that allows developers to manipulate and transform data in real-time as it flows through the AppSync API. The VTL pipeline includes a set of predefined functions that can be used to transform the incoming data before it is returned to the client. These functions include conditional statements, string manipulation functions, and data transformation functions.

Developers can also create custom VTL functions to perform more advanced data transformations. Custom VTL functions can be defined in the AppSync console or through the AWS CLI, and can be used in the same way as the built-in functions.

The VTL pipeline is a key component of the AppSync API, enabling developers to transform data in real-time and create powerful and flexible APIs that can be easily customized to meet the needs of their applications.
