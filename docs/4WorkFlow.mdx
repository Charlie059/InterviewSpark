# Company Communication and Workflow Guidelines

## Issues and Jira

Instead of using Github issues, the workflow requires the programmer to submit issues through Jira.

## Create issue and branch

üî¥‚ùó**IMPORTANT**‚ùóBranch names should be structured as `[Jira Ticket Number]-short-description`. E.g., `JIRA-123-fix-login-bug`.

üî¥‚ùó**IMPORTANT**‚ùóAll code changes should be committed to GitHub with meaningful commit messages. Every commit should reference the corresponding Jira ticket number.

üî¥‚ùó**IMPORTANT**‚ùóUpon committing or merging any changes, the corresponding Jira ticket should be updated with the status and any necessary comments.

## Pull Request and Issue Status

Pull requests in GitHub should be reviewed by at least one other team member. Once reviewed and approved, changes can be merged to the main branch.

## Communication in English

**Purpose:** Slack is our primary platform for internal communication. All team members are required to communicate in English on Slack to ensure a unified and clear understanding among team members from different backgrounds.

**Guidelines:**

- **Channels:** Use designated channels for specific discussions. For instance, `#marketing` for marketing-related conversations and `#dev` for development-related topics.
- **Direct Messages:** Use DMs for one-on-one conversations or discussions that don't pertain to the entire team.
- **Response Time:** While instant responses are not expected, please do your best to respond within 24 hours during weekdays.

## Slack Daily Check-In Using Standup Bot / Standup Meeting

**Purpose:** Utilize the Slack Standup Bot to automate and streamline our daily check-in process. This ensures consistent updates and eases the management of daily standups.

**Guidelines:**

- **Set Up:** Ensure every team member has the Standup Bot integrated into their Slack.
- **Frequency:** Every weekday.
- **Time:** The bot will prompt every team member for their updates at 10:30 AM [Your Time Zone] and reminders will be sent every 15 minutes until 10:30 AM for those who haven't responded.
- **Channel:** Standup Bot will consolidate all the updates and post a summarized report in the `#daily-standup` channel by 10:30 AM.
- **Format:** When prompted by the bot, please provide your updates in the following structure:
- What I did yesterday
- What I will do today
- Any blockers or challenges
- **Bot Commands:** Familiarize yourself with the bot commands:
- `/standup_configure`: Set or change your standup settings.
- `/standup_status`: Check the status of your standup for the day.
- (Any other relevant bot commands you wish to include.)

## Weekly Meeting

**Purpose:** Weekly meetings serve as a platform to discuss broader team objectives, align on goals, and address any significant challenges.

**Guidelines:**

- **Frequency:** Once a week.
- **Time:** Every Friday at 3:00 PM [Your Time Zone].
- **Platform:** Google Meeting. [Link]
- **Agenda:** To be shared 24 hours before the meeting. Team members are encouraged to add any items they wish to discuss.


## Code Requirements

**Purpose:** To ensure the quality, maintainability, and consistency of our codebase, we've set forth the following coding standards and practices:

**Guidelines:**

- **Coding Style:** Adhere to the style guide provided for the specific programming language. E.g., for Python, follow PEP 8.
- **Documentation:**
- **Inline Comments:** Use them sparingly to explain complex pieces of code or algorithms.
- **Docstrings:** Required for all functions, methods, and classes to describe their purpose and any parameters/returns.
- **Testing:**
- Every piece of new functionality must come with relevant unit tests or E2E test.
- Ensure that all tests pass before pushing code or creating a pull request.
- **Commit Messages:**
- Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose and context of the change.
- If related to a Jira ticket, include the ticket number at the beginning of the commit message.
- **Error Handling:**
- Always handle potential errors or exceptions gracefully.
- Provide informative error messages to help in debugging.
- **Dependencies:**
- Avoid adding unnecessary libraries or packages.
- If a new dependency is essential, ensure it is added to the relevant dependency management file (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python) and provide justification in your pull request.
- **Performance:**
- Write efficient code. Avoid nested loops or recursive functions where they can impact performance.
- Profile and optimize resource-intensive sections of the codebase.
- **Security:**
- Never hard-code sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
- Be wary of potential security vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with user input.
- Never upload `.env` file to git
- **Code Reviews:**
- Every pull request should be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- Address all feedback and concerns before merging.
