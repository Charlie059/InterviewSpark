# Document Writing
Every function and configuration are necessary to be documented.
Descriptive docs(without components) are located in `~/docs/`,
with `*.mdx` . Stories that required **addon** are located within
each folder of the component/function definition, with
`*.stories.mdx`.

## Storybook Configuration
To edit your storybook, please
refer to the following files:
```bash
.
├── .storybook
   ├── main.ts
   └── preview.ts
...

```

For example, if it requires Storybook to find more
story files in additional folder,
please edit `stories` and add more locations below
```ts
const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx','../docs/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],
  ...
```
## Front End Component Docs
This is the file structure example of Front-end Component: `<YourComponent>`.
To write the doc for component `YourComponent.tsx`,
you are responsible for writing `YourComponent.stories.mdx`.
```bash
.
├── Component
│   └── YourComponent
│       ├── YourComponent.stories.mdx
│       ├── YourComponent.test.tsx
│       └── YourComponent.tsx
```

MDX allows markdown mixing with jsx/tsx, each document
files that can be found by Storybook requires you to add the following import
and meta to your `.mdx` file:
```tsx
import { Meta, ArgsTable, Canvas, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

<Meta title='Components/YourComponent' component={YourComponent} />

```

Each doc must contain the following 3 parts:

- **Title**: with description about the summary of the component
- **Props**: all props of the component, arg table, and it's purpose
- **Usage**: include all possible code and stories to illustrate how to use the component

To include arg table in **Props**:
```tsx
<ArgsTable of={YourComponent} />
```

To display and test your component in the doc:
```tsx
<Canvas>
    <Story name='YourComponentName' args={{ title: 'Title' }}>
{
 //your react component defination
}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
```
It's also possible to include several Stories in one doc.

## Descriptive Docs
This is the file structure example of general documentation
that is purely descriptive. It does not involve any displacement
of function or component. It should only contain the docs for configurations,
general processes, introductions, and precautions.
```bash
.
├── docs
   ├── 1Intro.mdx
   └── 2QuickStart.mdx
...

```

Writing descriptive docs has no difference in writing markdown files,
but you are more than welcome to include your own defined component
for better illustration.
